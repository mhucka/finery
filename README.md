## Introduction

Urial is a command-line program written in Python 3 that allows you to write and update URIs in the Finder comments of a file. Urial makes it easier to write scripts (e.g., in Bash/Bourne shell syntax, or AppleScripts) that keep those URIs updated.

Incidentally, [urial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urial) (properly known as _Ovis vignei_) are a kind of wild sheep native to Central and South Asia. They are listed as a [vulnerable species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/54940655/195296049) and their population continues to twindle due to human activity, hunting, and climate change.
