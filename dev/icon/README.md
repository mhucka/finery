Icon sources for Urial
======================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/icon/bighorn-sheep-head-2608122/) of a sheep with horns, used as the icon for this repository, was created by  [Vectors Point](https://thenounproject.com/vectorspoint/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.

I created the files [urial-icon.icns](urial-icon.icns) and [urial-icon.ico](urial-icon.ico) using the macOS desktop application [iConvert Icons](https://iconverticons.com).
